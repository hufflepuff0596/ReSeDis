## Annotation
* For each object, we provide a json file. You can read the annotations using the following code:

```python
import json
with open('*.json', 'r') as f:
    infos = json.load(f)
```

* The format of annotations:
```
    <image_id>: the id of the image (same as in MSCOCO)
    <target_annotation>: segmentation mask of the target object
    <expression>: text description of the target object
    <category>: category of the target object
```
